TDDUnit - A Test-Driven Unit Testing Framework for C#
=====================================================

TDDUnit started out as my implementation of the xUnit-style unit testing framework developed in Kent Beck's _Test-Driven Development by Example._ Then it started growing into something more as I started developing my TDD powers. Now it's somewhere in the middle of being useless and being surprisingly useable.

The goal is to integrate it into the MSBuild tool as a custom build task.
